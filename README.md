### Simple but very practical, it provides the following features.

- You can add what you need to do today in the list.
- When you finish some of these things, you can clear it.Things that are cleared by you can be viewed in the Done tab.
- You can empty the finished thing.
- Whenever you refresh the page, the app will randomly display a love poem ðŸ’Œ.
